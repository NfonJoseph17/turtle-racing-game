# turtle-racing-game

This project is a fun and interactive Turtle Racing Game built using Python's `turtle` module. Players can choose the number of racers (turtles) and watch them race to the finish line. The game randomly determines a winner based on each turtle's speed and distance covered.

## Features

- **Interactive Input**: Players can specify the number of turtles racing (between 2 to 10).
- **Colorful Racers**: Each turtle racer is assigned a random color from a diverse palette.
- **Randomized Race Dynamics**: The speed and distance of each turtle are randomly generated, ensuring a unique race every time.
- **Visual Display**: The game uses Python's `turtle` graphics to visually display the race in a window.

1. **Start the Game**: Run the Python script to start the game.
2. **Enter Number of Racers**: Input the number of turtles you want to participate in the race (between 2 to 10).
3. **Watch the Race**: The turtles will begin racing across the screen, each moving at a different speed.
4. **Announce the Winner**: The first turtle to cross the finish line is declared the winner.
